# Student Exam Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the relationship between various student habits and their exam performance using data visualization and analysis techniques.  
The goal is to determine which factors most strongly influence exam scores.

---

## Objective
To identify which factors — such as study hours, previous academic performance, sleep duration, and attendance — have the greatest impact on exam results.

## Files
student_exam_scores.csv - Dataset containing details of students' study hours, sleep, attendance, previous marks, and exam scores. 
Student_Exam_Performance_Analysis.twbx - Tableau Workbook containing dashboards and scatter plots visualizing the data relationships.

## Key Visualizations
1. **Exam Score vs. Hours Studied**  
   - Strong positive correlation  
   - Students who study more tend to score higher.

2. **Exam Score vs. Previous Scores**  
   - Moderate positive correlation  
   - Previous academic performance influences current results.

3. **Exam Score vs. Sleep Hours**  
   - Weak or no correlation  
   - Sleep does not strongly affect exam performance in this dataset.

4. **Exam Score vs. Attendance Percentage**  
   - No clear relationship  
   - Attendance alone does not determine exam success.

## Insights
- Studying more hours is the strongest predictor of higher exam scores.  
- Previous performance also plays a role in exam success.  
- Sleep hours and attendance show minimal influence on exam results.

## Conclusion
The project concludes that study effort (hours studied) is the most impactful factor in determining student performance.  
Other variables like previous marks have moderate influence, while sleep and attendance have little measurable effect.
